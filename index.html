        <p class="para_box"> We haven't properly introduced ourselves. We are RSC Games. We are an independent game developer that stands 
            by the power of the indie game. We believe that the quality of a game doesn't necessarily come from the size of the team or 
            the budget.
        </p>
        <p class="para_box">
            What, then, affects a game? The availability of good tools and, most important of all, passion. We are passionate developers
            who strive to provide excellent quality tools and applications, whether it is a game console, game engine, or superb game. 
            We also believe strongly in supporting the homebrew community, from which many excellent games have been released.
        </p>
        <p class="para_box">
            Below, you'll find the products of our vision that have already become reality. Join us as we change the console and indie game
            development market for the better!
