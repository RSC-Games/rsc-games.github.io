        <p> We have created a revolutionary new model for game development and distribution! Our model, "cheap hardware, free games," 
            ensures you always have games to play, and you don't have to spend a penny! We host online services like online interaction,
            checking friend status, and cloud save backups. Running online services is expensive for us and therefore save backups
            are a premium feature. We also accept donations on our company <a class="link_std" href="#We don't have a Patreon yet."> Patreon </a>. This
            money will be used to fund online services, pay our third party developers, and pay our first party development team.
            Without our game developers, our system would be worthless.
        </p>
        <!-- Add image at some point here and set up the box. -->

        <br>
        <p> Each system currently is planned to come with a 16 GB SanDisk Ultra microSD Card for storage and a few pre-installed applications!
            These include services like Download Play. The system also has WiFi so online gaming and friend interaction are easily possible.
            For the game developers out there we also offer a development console line.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p> Currently our system is in early beta development, so it will still be a long time until it is widely available, but preview units
            may be issued to beta testers in the near future, so please check our site for updates!
